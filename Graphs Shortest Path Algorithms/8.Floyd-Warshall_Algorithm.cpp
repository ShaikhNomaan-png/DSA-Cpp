/*  ðŸ”¹ Problem: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

Floyd-Warshall is an all-pairs shortest path algorithm.

You are given:

n vertices

A weighted directed graph (can have negative edges, but no negative cycles)

Goal: Find shortest distance between all pairs of vertices.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points

Handles negative weights.

Detects negative cycles if dist[i][i] < 0.

Time Complexity: O(n^3)

ðŸ”¹ Algorithm Idea

Initialize dist[i][j] = weight of edge iâ†’j (INF if no edge)

For every vertex k (intermediate node):

for i in 0..n-1:
    for j in 0..n-1:
        dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])


After all iterations, dist[i][j] = shortest distance from i to j.

ðŸ”¹ Example Graph
Vertices = 4
Edges:
0 â†’ 1 (5)
0 â†’ 3 (10)
1 â†’ 2 (3)
2 â†’ 3 (1)

ðŸ”¹ Explanation

dist[0][2] = 8 â†’ Path: 0â†’1â†’2 = 5 + 3 = 8

dist[0][3] = 9 â†’ Path: 0â†’1â†’2â†’3 = 5+3+1=9 (better than direct 0â†’3=10)

dist[1][3] = 4 â†’ Path: 1â†’2â†’3 = 3+1=4

INF = No path exists between those vertices

âœ… This output gives shortest distances between all pairs.

/* Sure! Letâ€™s **explain the output of Floyd-Warshall step by step** so you clearly see how each value is computed.

## ðŸ”¹ Graph Recap

Vertices = 4 (0,1,2,3)
Edges:

```
0 â†’ 1 = 5
0 â†’ 3 = 10
1 â†’ 2 = 3
2 â†’ 3 = 1
```

Initial distance matrix (INF = no edge, 0 = self distance):

|   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| - | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0   | 5   | INF | 10  |
| 1 | INF | 0   | 3   | INF |
| 2 | INF | INF | 0   | 1   |
| 3 | INF | INF | INF | 0   |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Using vertex `k = 0` as intermediate

For all pairs `(i,j)`, check if `dist[i][0] + dist[0][j] < dist[i][j]`:

* `dist[0][1]`: min(5, 0+5)=5 â†’ no change
* `dist[0][2]`: min(INF, 0+INF)=INF â†’ no change
* `dist[0][3]`: min(10, 0+10)=10 â†’ no change
* Other rows: no updates because `dist[1][0] = INF`, `dist[2][0] = INF`, etc.

**Matrix after k=0:**

|   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| - | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0   | 5   | INF | 10  |
| 1 | INF | 0   | 3   | INF |
| 2 | INF | INF | 0   | 1   |
| 3 | INF | INF | INF | 0   |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Using vertex `k = 1` as intermediate

Check `dist[i][j] > dist[i][1] + dist[1][j]`:

* `dist[0][2]`: min(INF, dist[0][1]+dist[1][2]=5+3=8) â†’ updated to 8
* `dist[0][3]`: min(10, dist[0][1]+dist[1][3]=5+INF=INF) â†’ stays 10
* `dist[1][3]`: min(INF, dist[1][1]+dist[1][3]=0+INF=INF) â†’ stays INF

**Matrix after k=1:**

|   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| - | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0   | 5   | 8   | 10  |
| 1 | INF | 0   | 3   | INF |
| 2 | INF | INF | 0   | 1   |
| 3 | INF | INF | INF | 0   |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Using vertex `k = 2` as intermediate

* `dist[0][3]`: min(10, dist[0][2]+dist[2][3]=8+1=9) â†’ updated to 9
* `dist[1][3]`: min(INF, dist[1][2]+dist[2][3]=3+1=4) â†’ updated to 4

**Matrix after k=2:**

|   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3 |
| - | --- | --- | --- | - |
| 0 | 0   | 5   | 8   | 9 |
| 1 | INF | 0   | 3   | 4 |
| 2 | INF | INF | 0   | 1 |
| 3 | INF | INF | INF | 0 |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Using vertex `k = 3` as intermediate

* No updates, since `3` has no outgoing edges except self-loop.

**Final matrix:**

|   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3 |
| - | --- | --- | --- | - |
| 0 | 0   | 5   | 8   | 9 |
| 1 | INF | 0   | 3   | 4 |
| 2 | INF | INF | 0   | 1 |
| 3 | INF | INF | INF | 0 |

---

## ðŸ”¹ How Output Comes

* `dist[0][2] = 8` â†’ shortest path 0â†’1â†’2 = 5+3=8
* `dist[0][3] = 9` â†’ shortest path 0â†’1â†’2â†’3 = 5+3+1=9
* `dist[1][3] = 4` â†’ shortest path 1â†’2â†’3 = 3+1=4
* `INF` = no path exists between those vertices

---

âœ… **Output Explanation Complete**
This is how Floyd-Warshall iteratively **improves distances using each vertex as intermediate**.

---

If you want, I can **draw the graph and highlight all shortest paths** visuallyâ€”it makes understanding much easier.

Do you want me to do that?
