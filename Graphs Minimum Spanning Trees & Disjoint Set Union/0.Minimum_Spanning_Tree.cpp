/*  Sure! Letâ€™s cover **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** in full detail.

# ðŸ”¹ What is a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?

Given a **connected, weighted, undirected graph**, a **spanning tree** is a subset of edges that:

1. Connects **all vertices** (no vertex is left out).
2. Forms **no cycles** (tree property).

A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is a spanning tree with **minimum total edge weight** among all possible spanning trees.

---

# ðŸ”¹ Key Properties of MST

1. **Number of edges** in MST = V - 1 (V = number of vertices).
2. **No cycles**.
3. **Minimum total weight** among all spanning trees.
4. Multiple MSTs may exist if edges have equal weights.

# ðŸ”¹ Algorithms to Find MST

1. **Primâ€™s Algorithm (G-42)**

   * Starts from a vertex and grows MST by **adding minimum weight edge connecting MST to outside**.
   * Good for **dense graphs**.
   * Time Complexity:

     * Using adjacency matrix: O(VÂ²)
     * Using adjacency list + min-heap: O(E log V)

2. **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm**

   * Sort all edges by weight.
   * Pick edges **smallest to largest** while avoiding cycles (using Union-Find).
   * Good for **sparse graphs**.
   * Time Complexity: O(E log E)

# ðŸ”¹ Example Graph

```
Vertices = 5
Edges (Undirected, weight):
0 - 1 = 2
0 - 3 = 6
1 - 2 = 3
1 - 3 = 8
1 - 4 = 5
2 - 4 = 7
3 - 4 = 9
```

Graph diagram:

```
      2
  0 ------- 1
  | \       |
 6|  \8     |5
  |   \     |
  3-------4
       9
```

# ðŸ”¹ MST Using Primâ€™s Algorithm

### Steps:

1. Start at **vertex 0**.
2. Choose **minimum edge from 0**: 0â€“1 (2) â†’ include 1.
3. Choose **minimum edge connecting MST to outside**: 1â€“2 (3) â†’ include 2.
4. Choose next minimum: 1â€“4 (5) â†’ include 4.
5. Next: 0â€“3 (6) â†’ include 3.
6. All vertices included â†’ MST complete.

### MST Edges:

```
0â€“1 (2), 1â€“2 (3), 1â€“4 (5), 0â€“3 (6)
```

### Total weight:

```
2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 16
```

---

# ðŸ”¹ MST Using Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm

### Steps:

1. Sort edges by weight:

```
0â€“1(2), 1â€“2(3), 1â€“4(5), 0â€“3(6), 2â€“4(7), 1â€“3(8), 3â€“4(9)
```

2. Pick smallest edge: 0â€“1 (2) â†’ include
3. Pick 1â€“2 (3) â†’ include
4. Pick 1â€“4 (5) â†’ include
5. Pick 0â€“3 (6) â†’ include
6. Remaining edges would form cycles â†’ skip

âœ… Total weight = 16 (same as Primâ€™s)

---

# ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways

* MST connects **all vertices with minimum cost**.
* Both **Primâ€™s** and **Kruskalâ€™s** can find MST, results may vary if multiple MSTs exist.
* Used in **network design**, **cable laying**, **road construction**, **cluster analysis**.

Do you want me to **write the full C++ code for both Primâ€™s and Kruskalâ€™s MST algorithms** with outputs so you can compare?
