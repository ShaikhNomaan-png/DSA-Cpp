/*  Sure! Letâ€™s explain the **output of the Course Schedule I problem**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Recap

* Courses: `0` to `3` (`numCourses = 4`)

* Prerequisites: `[[1,0],[2,1],[3,2]]` â†’ meaning:

  * To take course `1`, you must first take `0`
  * To take course `2`, you must first take `1`
  * To take course `3`, you must first take `2`

* **Goal:** Check if all courses can be finished.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Graph Representation

* Nodes: `0,1,2,3`
* Directed edges (prerequisites):

```
0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3
```

* This is a **linear chain**, no cycles.

---

## ðŸ”¹ BFS (Topological Sort) Step-by-Step

1. **Compute in-degree of all nodes**:

| Node | In-degree |
| ---- | --------- |
| 0    | 0         |
| 1    | 1         |
| 2    | 1         |
| 3    | 1         |

2. **Initialize queue** with nodes having in-degree `0`: `[0]`

3. **Process queue**:

   * Pop `0` â†’ count = 1 â†’ reduce in-degree of `1` â†’ in-degree of `1` becomes 0 â†’ push `1`
   * Pop `1` â†’ count = 2 â†’ reduce in-degree of `2` â†’ in-degree of `2` becomes 0 â†’ push `2`
   * Pop `2` â†’ count = 3 â†’ reduce in-degree of `3` â†’ in-degree of `3` becomes 0 â†’ push `3`
   * Pop `3` â†’ count = 4 â†’ queue empty

4. **Check processed nodes**: `count = 4` = `numCourses` â†’ all courses can be finished âœ…

---

## ðŸ”¹ Output

```
All courses can be finished
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why the Output is Correct

* The graph has **no cycles**
* BFS / topological sort successfully processes **all nodes**
* A valid course order exists: `0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example with Cycle

Prerequisites: `[[1,0],[0,1]]`

* Graph: `0 â†’ 1 â†’ 0`
* BFS queue initially `[0]`
* Only `0` processed â†’ `count = 1 < numCourses = 2` â†’ cycle exists
* Output:

```
Cannot finish all courses (cycle exists)
```

âœ… Shows why cycle prevents finishing all courses.

---

This is exactly how the **BFS-based topological sort** determines if all courses can be finished.

If you want, I can also explain the **DFS-based solution with recursion stack** in short for Course Schedule I, which is commonly asked in interviews.

Do you want me to do that?
