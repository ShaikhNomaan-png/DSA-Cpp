Got it âœ…
You want **complete, detailed notes on OOP in C++** â€” explained in a **clear, placement-oriented way**, but without writing full codes (only conceptual + small snippets if needed).

Hereâ€™s a **complete OOP Notes Handbook** for your **placement prep** ðŸ‘‡

# ðŸ“˜ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

---

## 1. What is OOP?

* **Definition**: OOP is a programming paradigm based on **objects**.
* Objects represent **real-world entities** (like Car, Student, BankAccount).
* They combine **data (attributes)** and **functions (methods)** in one unit (class).

---

## 2. Principles of OOP

### ðŸ”¹ (a) Class and Object

* **Class**: Blueprint/template that defines properties & methods.
* **Object**: Instance of a class (created in memory).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```cpp
class Car { 
    int speed;
    void drive();
};
Car c1; // object
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ (b) Encapsulation

* Wrapping of **data + functions** in one unit (class).
* Data hiding â†’ achieved using **private members**.
* Access via **public getters & setters**.

ðŸ‘‰ Why?

* Protects data from outside interference.
* Provides controlled access.

---

### ðŸ”¹ (c) Abstraction

* Hiding implementation details, showing only **essential features**.
* Achieved using:

  * **Abstract Class** (contains pure virtual functions).
  * **Interfaces** (in C++, via pure virtual functions).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
A `Shape` class with a `draw()` function â†’ only derived classes (`Circle`, `Rectangle`) implement it.

---

### ðŸ”¹ (d) Inheritance

* Mechanism by which one class (child) acquires properties & methods of another class (parent).
* Promotes **code reusability**.

**Types of Inheritance in C++**:

1. **Single** â†’ One base â†’ One derived.
2. **Multiple** â†’ One derived inherits from multiple bases.
3. **Multilevel** â†’ Base â†’ Derived â†’ Another derived.
4. **Hierarchical** â†’ One base â†’ Multiple derived.
5. **Hybrid** â†’ Combination (can cause Diamond Problem).

ðŸ‘‰ **Access specifiers in inheritance**:

* `public` â†’ public stays public, protected stays protected.
* `protected` â†’ public becomes protected, protected stays protected.
* `private` â†’ everything becomes private.

---

### ðŸ”¹ (e) Polymorphism

* **Polymorphism = Many forms** (same function behaving differently).

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism** (Static Binding):

   * Function overloading (same function name, different parameters).
   * Operator overloading (`+`, `-`, `[]`, etc. customized for objects).

2. **Run-time Polymorphism** (Dynamic Binding):

   * Function overriding â†’ child class provides specific implementation of a parentâ€™s virtual function.
   * Achieved using **virtual functions**.

ðŸ‘‰ **Virtual Destructor** is used when deleting a derived object via a base pointer (to avoid memory leaks).

---

## 3. Constructors and Destructors

* **Constructor**: Special function automatically called when object is created.

  * Types: Default, Parameterized, Copy Constructor.
* **Destructor**: Special function called when object is destroyed (`~ClassName`).

ðŸ‘‰ Order of execution in inheritance:

* **Base constructor â†’ Derived constructor**
* **Derived destructor â†’ Base destructor**

---

## 4. Advanced OOP Concepts

### ðŸ”¹ Friend Function

* Allows a **non-member function** to access private/protected members of a class.
* Declared using `friend` keyword.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Operator Overloading

* Redefining operators for user-defined types.
* Example: Overloading `+` for adding two complex numbers.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Copy Constructor

* Initializes an object using another object.
* **Shallow copy**: Copies only values (can cause pointer issues).
* **Deep copy**: Creates a separate copy of dynamically allocated memory.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Static Members

* **Static variables** â†’ shared across all objects (common memory).
* **Static functions** â†’ can be called without object, but can access only static members.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Virtual Functions & V-Table

* Virtual functions enable **runtime polymorphism**.
* Each class with virtual functions maintains a **V-Table** (Virtual Table).
* A base class pointer pointing to a derived class object executes derived classâ€™s function.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Abstract Classes

* A class with at least **one pure virtual function** (`virtual void f()=0;`).
* Cannot create objects of abstract class.
* Used as **base class for polymorphism**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Diamond Problem (Hybrid Inheritance Issue)

* Occurs in multiple inheritance when two parent classes inherit from the same base.
* Causes **ambiguity**.
* Solution: Use **virtual inheritance**.

## 5. OOP vs POP (Comparison)

| Feature          | OOP                         | POP (Procedural Oriented) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Approach         | Object-based                | Function-based            |
| Data Security    | Encapsulation (data hiding) | No data hiding            |
| Reusability      | Through Inheritance         | Difficult                 |
| Example Language | C++, Java, Python           | C, Pascal                 |

## 6. Common Interview Questions on OOP in C++

1. **What is the difference between class and struct in C++?**

   * Class members â†’ private by default.
   * Struct members â†’ public by default.

2. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**

   * Encapsulation â†’ wrapping + data hiding.
   * Abstraction â†’ hiding implementation.

3. **Explain function overloading vs overriding.**

   * Overloading â†’ Compile-time.
   * Overriding â†’ Runtime, requires virtual keyword.

4. **Why do we need virtual destructors?**

   * To properly delete derived objects via base pointers.

5. **What is the Diamond Problem in C++? How to solve it?**

   * Ambiguity in multiple inheritance.
   * Solve with `virtual` inheritance.

6. **Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy?**

   * Shallow â†’ Copies only values.
   * Deep â†’ Copies allocated memory separately.
