/* Polymorphism
Definition: Ability of one function/operator to behave differently.
Definition: "Many forms" â€” ability of functions or objects to behave differently depending on the context.
Types:
1. Compile-time (Static Polymorphism): Function overloading, operator overloading.
2. Run-time (Dynamic Polymorphism): Virtual functions, achieved via late binding.
Benefits: Flexibility and reusability.
