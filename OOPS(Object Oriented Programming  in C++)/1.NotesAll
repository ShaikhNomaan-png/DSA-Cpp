# üìò Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ ‚Äî Detailed Notes

---

## 1. Introduction to OOP

* **Definition:**
  Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm where programs are organized around *objects* instead of functions. Objects combine both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
* **Purpose:**

  * Makes code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
  * Provides a way to model real-world entities in software.

**Key Features of OOP:**

1. **Encapsulation** ‚Üí Wrapping data and methods in one unit (class).
2. **Abstraction** ‚Üí Hiding implementation details and showing only essentials.
3. **Inheritance** ‚Üí Deriving new classes from existing ones.
4. **Polymorphism** ‚Üí Ability to take multiple forms (function/operator overloading, virtual functions).

---

## 2. Class and Object

* **Class:**
  A blueprint or template that defines attributes (variables) and behaviors (functions).
* **Object:**
  An instance of a class, representing a real-world entity.
* **Analogy:**
  A *class* is like a blueprint of a car, while an *object* is the actual car built from that blueprint.

---

## 3. Encapsulation

* **Definition:** Binding data and functions together in a single unit (class).
* **Purpose:** Data hiding, modularity, and better security.
* **Advantages:**

  * Prevents direct access to internal data.
  * Provides controlled access through methods (getters/setters).
  * Makes code easier to modify without affecting external users.

---

## 4. Abstraction

* **Definition:** Showing only essential details to the user and hiding the internal implementation.
* **How it‚Äôs done in C++:**

  * Using abstract classes (with pure virtual functions).
  * Using interfaces.
* **Example in real life:**

  * Driving a car ‚Üí You only see the steering and pedals, not the engine mechanics.

**Benefits:**

* Reduces complexity.
* Focuses on ‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù rather than ‚Äúhow to do.‚Äù
* Increases security by hiding unnecessary details.

---

## 5. Inheritance

* **Definition:** Process by which one class (derived class/child) acquires properties and behavior of another class (base class/parent).
* **Types of Inheritance:**

  1. **Single Inheritance** ‚Üí One child inherits from one parent.
  2. **Multiple Inheritance** ‚Üí One child inherits from multiple parents.
  3. **Multilevel Inheritance** ‚Üí A class inherits from another derived class.
  4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** ‚Üí Multiple classes inherit from one parent.
  5. **Hybrid Inheritance** ‚Üí Combination of more than one type of inheritance.

**Advantages:**

* Promotes code reusability.
* Improves modularity.
* Establishes a relationship between classes (is-a relationship).

**Disadvantage:**

* Can lead to complexity (especially multiple/hybrid inheritance).

---

## 6. Polymorphism

* **Definition:** "Many forms" ‚Äî ability of functions or objects to behave differently depending on the context.
* **Types of Polymorphism:**

  1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static):**

     * Function overloading ‚Üí Same function name with different parameters.
     * Operator overloading ‚Üí Redefining operators for user-defined types.
  2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic):**

     * Achieved using virtual functions.
     * Decided at runtime through *dynamic dispatch*.

**Benefits:**

* Increases flexibility.
* Supports code extensibility.
* Allows same interface to be used for different data types or behaviors.

---

## 7. Constructor and Destructor

* **Constructor:**

  * Special function that initializes an object.
  * Called automatically when an object is created.
  * Types: Default, Parameterized, Copy constructor.
* **Destructor:**

  * Special function that destroys an object and releases resources.
  * Called automatically when the object goes out of scope.
* **Rule:**
  If constructors are overloaded, destructors cannot be overloaded.

---

## 8. Friend Function

* **Definition:**
  A function that is not part of the class but has permission to access private and protected members of that class.
* **Use Case:**

  * When two classes need to share some private data.
  * Helps in operator overloading.

---

## 9. Operator Overloading

* **Definition:** Giving additional meaning to existing operators for user-defined types.
* **Examples:**

  * `+` can be used to add two complex numbers.
  * `==` can be used to compare objects.
* **Limitations:**

  * Cannot create new operators.
  * Some operators (like `.` and `::`) cannot be overloaded.

---

## 10. Static Members

* **Static Data Members:**

  * Shared by all objects of a class.
  * Have a single copy stored in memory.
* **Static Member Functions:**

  * Can be called without creating an object.
  * Can access only static data members.

---

## 11. Virtual Functions and Virtual Destructors

* **Virtual Function:**

  * Declared in the base class using the `virtual` keyword.
  * Allows derived classes to override base class functions.
  * Supports run-time polymorphism.
* **Virtual Destructor:**

  * Ensures proper destruction of derived class objects when deleted through base class pointers.
  * Without a virtual destructor, only the base class destructor will be called.

---

## 12. Abstract Class and Interface

* **Abstract Class:**

  * Contains at least one pure virtual function (`=0`).
  * Cannot be instantiated directly.
* **Interface:**

  * A fully abstract class where all functions are pure virtual.
  * Provides a contract that derived classes must implement.

---

## 13. Copy Constructor

* **Definition:**
  Constructor that initializes a new object as a copy of another object.
* **Types of Copying:**

  * **Shallow Copy:** Copies only the data, not dynamically allocated memory.
  * **Deep Copy:** Creates a new copy of dynamically allocated memory as well.

---

## 14. Function Overloading vs Function Overriding

* **Overloading:**

  * Same function name, different parameters.
  * Achieved at compile-time.
* **Overriding:**

  * Redefining base class function in derived class.
  * Achieved at run-time using virtual functions.

---

## 15. OOP in Real-Life Examples

* **Encapsulation:** ATM machine ‚Üí user presses buttons, inner working is hidden.
* **Abstraction:** Car ‚Üí you drive using steering, pedals, gear, without knowing engine details.
* **Inheritance:** Child inherits traits from parents.
* **Polymorphism:** A person behaves differently as a student, employee, or friend.

---

## 16. Advantages of OOP

1. Code reusability (through inheritance).
2. Better maintainability.
3. Data security (through encapsulation and abstraction).
4. Modularity.
5. Supports real-world modeling.

---

## 17. Disadvantages of OOP

1. Slightly more complex than procedural programming.
2. Requires more memory and processing power.
3. Not always suitable for small-scale programs.

* Types:

  1. **Default Constructor** ‚Üí no parameters.
  2. **Parameterized Constructor** ‚Üí takes arguments.
  3. **Copy Constructor** ‚Üí initializes an object as a copy of another.
