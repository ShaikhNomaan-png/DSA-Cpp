/*  Inheritance in C++
ðŸ“˜ Notes:
Inheritance is when a class (child/derived class) acquires properties & behaviors of another class (parent/base class).
Reusability of code = main advantage.
Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties/methods of another class (parent).
Types:
Single
Multiple
Multilevel
Hierarchical
Hybrid
ðŸ“Œ Summary Table
| Type         | Structure                                 | Example                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Single       | One base â†’ One derived                    | `Animal â†’ Dog`               |
| Multiple     | Multiple bases â†’ One derived              | `Engine + Wheels â†’ Car`      |
| Multilevel   | Chain (Base â†’ Derived â†’ Derived)          | `LivingBeing â†’ Animal â†’ Dog` |
| Hierarchical | One base â†’ Multiple derived               | `Shape â†’ Circle, Rectangle`  |
| Hybrid       | Combination (e.g., Multiple + Multilevel) | `Diamond Problem`            |

ðŸ”¹ 1. Single Inheritance
